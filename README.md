## PUCKET

### FINGER FLICKING FUN FOR NEARLY EVERYONE

Pucket is a frantic dexterity game. Players race each other to catapult the pucks from their side of the board through a small hole leading to the other side. There are no turns and any pucks that arrive on your side must be sent back before you win. Pucket games are hand-crafted in India from sheesham wood. 54 x 40cm.

## AWKWARD PUCKET EXTENSION PACK

### FINGER FLICKING AWKWARDNESS FOR NEARLY EVERYONE
THE AWKWARD PUCK EXTENSION PACK FEATURES DASTARDLY SHAPED PUCKS THAT REQUIRE SPECIAL TECHNIQUES TO FIT THROUGH THE HOLE. WE FIND IT ADDS A WHOLE NEW LEVEL OF COMEDY STRESSFUL-NESS TO PUCKET MATCHES.

The Awkward pucks include: the flying saucer, whose rounded edges cause it to fly up when fired; the fatboy, who only just fits through the gate; the wedgie, specially shaped to wedge under the elastic on the other side; the long face, who only fits through longways; the crabâ€™s claw, that must be fired wrist-first; the two timer, which forces you to get two pucks through at once; and the lopsidewinder, whose embedded weight makes it swerve off to one side. The pack includes two of each kind of puck plus instructions.
